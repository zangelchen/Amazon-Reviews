Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, with millions of products and reviews. The data generated by these reviews can provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, product features, and more. In this proposal, we propose to conduct a data analysis of Amazon reviews to gain a better understanding of customer opinions and preferences. This data analysis of Amazon reviews will provide valuable insights into customer opinions and preferences, which can be used to improve product features, customer service, and overall customer satisfaction. The results will be presented making it easy for stakeholders to access and understand the insights generated by the analysis.
