Our mission is to analyze the trends in digital music sales vs physical music sales by analyzing customer reviews to derive the popular features for the items. We aim to ensure informed purchases for personal and corporate buyers by providing a comprehensive analysis of the trends. This collaboration strives to educate and inform consumers about the popular and least popular form of musics to inform potential artists of what sells in the market.
