# Python API Project - What's the Weather Like?

# Background

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

# Part I - WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

To see my Python script, check jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/kanamoore/python-api-challenge/blob/master/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb)

## Observation

- Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.

- "Highest temperature is found at 0 latitude and as the latidude increases or decreases, temperature drops. This happens as equatorial region receives sunlight straight with less or no angle due to curvature shape of earth.\n",

- "Latitude doesn't have a strong iinfluence on wind speed. The speed of the wind is controlled by the strength of the air pressure gradient, the stronger the pressure gradient the higher the wind speed. "

## Objectives

My first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Part I: Roger

Part II: CD/Vinyl vs Digital Mussic comparative analysis of overall rating 



Part III: Sales vs Rating Analysis

Objective: Determine the total sale and average rating for each artist to derive potential correlations between the two data points to inform future stakeholders whether the higher rating guarentees higher sales. 

Functions used: 
- Groupby
- Creating dataframe
- Sort_Value
- Ascending
- Plt.Scatter
- Plt.Bar
- Plt.Pie



Findings: There is a very week positive correlation between Total Sales and Average Ratings. While the highest sales did have high ratings, there are also artists that had high ratings but few reviews.
