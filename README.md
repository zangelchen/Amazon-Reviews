Part III: Sales vs Rating Analysis

Objective: Determine the total sale and average rating for each artist to derive potential correlations between the two data points to inform future stakeholders whether the higher rating guarentees higher sales. 

Functions used: 
- Groupby
- Creating dataframe
- Sort_Value
- Ascending
- Plt.Scatter
- Plt.Bar
- Plt.Pie

Findings: There is a very week positive correlation between Total Sales and Average Ratings. While the highest sales did have high ratings, there are also artists that had high ratings but few reviews.
